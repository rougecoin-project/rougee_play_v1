# Lighthouse Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem:

The application was encountering 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to fetch user files from Lighthouse IPFS storage because the `getUploads` method was being called without proper authentication.

## Solution:

1. **Updated the `getUserFiles` method in `lighthouse.ts`** to properly authenticate using:
   - `getAuthMessage` to retrieve an authentication challenge
   - `signMessage` to sign the challenge with the user's wallet
   - Pass both address and signed message to `getUploads`

2. **Updated `loadMyFiles` in `UploadPage.tsx`** to:
   - Get the authenticated signer from the hook
   - Pass the signer to the `getUserFiles` method
   - Properly handle authentication flow

3. **Implemented `getAllNetworkFiles` method** to:
   - Use proper authentication for fetching files
   - Process metadata files to extract music information
   - Return formatted data for the network discovery tab

4. **Updated `loadAllFiles` in `UploadPage.tsx`** to:
   - Use the authenticated signer
   - Process data from the real API instead of mock data
   - Format the response to match the UI requirements

5. **Enhanced type definitions** to better support the data formats returned by the API

## Documentation:
   
1. **Updated README.md** to include Lighthouse integration details
2. **Created LIGHTHOUSE_GUIDE.md** with detailed information on:
   - Authentication flow
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Usage examples
   - Resources for further reference

## Impact:

These changes should resolve the 401 authentication errors when fetching user files. Users will now be able to:

1. Successfully upload music with metadata
2. View their uploaded files in the "My Files" tab
3. Discover music from the network in the "Network" tab

All interactions with Lighthouse storage are now properly authenticated using wallet signatures, ensuring secure file ownership and access.
